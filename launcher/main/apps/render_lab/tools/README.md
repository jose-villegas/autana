# Render Lab tools

Host-only scripts; the firmware build skips this folder. The render harness
itself is [`docs/tools/Render-Harness.md`](../../../../../docs/tools/Render-Harness.md).

## Host renders

```sh
./launcher/main/apps/render_lab/tools/render_lab_render_host.sh
```

Writes every declared scene under `tools/results/render/render_lab/`:
`gouraud-landscape.bmp` is the shaded cube, `cornell-landscape.bmp` the
software ray-traced room. The integer scenes are pinned with the HUD hidden;
the HUD renders are `|nopin`, since its fps readout is a `double` printed
with `"%.1f"`, and so are the Cornell scenes, which are float throughout.
The fps text comes from the host fixture - time the board with a device
capture. The Gouraud scene rotates when stepped over several frames.

## Images in the docs

`doc_images.sh` here makes these in `docs/images/overview/`, run by
`launcher/tools/render/render_doc_images.sh`; see "Images in these docs" in
[`docs/tools/Render-Harness.md`](../../../../../docs/tools/Render-Harness.md).

| Image | Shows |
|---|---|
| `render-lab-cube.png`, `render-lab-cube.gif` | the Gouraud cube; the GIF plays the rotation forward and back |
| `render-lab-cornell.png` | the ray-traced Cornell box, fully resolved, no HUD |
| `render-lab-sponza.gif` | the start of the Sponza flythrough |

## Sponza triangle sizes

```sh
./launcher/main/apps/render_lab/tools/report_sponza_triangle_sizes.sh [--write DIR | --against DIR]
```

At the poses `suite_sponza_perf.c` times, how many drawn triangles cover
0, 1, 2-4 or more pixel centres. `--write` keeps each pose's frame and
`--against` diffs a later build's frames with them, pixel by pixel.

## The capybara test asset

`gen_capybara.py` writes `../assets/capybara.glb`, a rigged low-poly capybara
modelled entirely in code: 1336 triangles, 20 joints, and two looping clips at
30 fps, `idle` (3.5 s) and an in-place `walk` (1 s, no root motion). It is a
plain glTF 2.0 file, the input a skinned-mesh baker is tested with.

```sh
python launcher/main/apps/render_lab/tools/gen_capybara.py
python -m unittest discover -s launcher/main/apps/render_lab/tools/tests
```

The file is read back and posed with the engine's glTF tools in
[`launcher/tools/r3d/`](../../../../tools/r3d/README.md); to watch it:

```sh
python launcher/tools/r3d/gltf_preview.py launcher/main/apps/render_lab/assets/capybara.glb --gif walk --out walk.gif
```
